# Blogo, a simple Go blog engine

Blogo is the blog engine that I use to fuel my personal [blog](www.wafonro.com).

To get the repository use

```
go get github.com/wafonro/blogo

```

Then for building the project inside the blogo folder:
```
go build

```
For runnning the server:

```
./blogo

```

Put your blog posts in the view folder as a markdown file, for example "example.md" will be available at
"localhost:8080/view/example"
